# MFECDataChallenge
Data Analysis on Supermarket Transactions

This repository is intended as a response to my interview assignment at MFEC co. 

I will convey my analysis and work on my Jupyter Notebook. Please feel free to observe and evaluate my work on it anyway.
Along with the notebook, I have pushed the the original csv file and the apriori library which is one of the library I used in the notebook. 

If you have any queries or questions, please contact me through my email.
